My name is yostos. Formerly working as a software engineer and architect at IBM and AWS. Recently, I've been rediscovering the joy of playing the guitar, which I used to play, and I'm enjoying it once again.

I have a deep love for cars—especially SUBARU—computers, guitars, and new experiences. And, of course, that first sip of morning coffee, which almost convinces me that all is right with the world.

When I find the time, I write here about the things that inspire me. You might enjoy reading about software, Macs, gadgets, guitars, or my enthusiasm for SUBARU.

At seventeen, I discovered home computers, and they have fascinated me ever since. With over 30 years of experience as an engineer, technology continues to be a central part of my life.

With the limited time I have left, I want to make the most of it by sharing my thoughts and experiences on this weblog.
