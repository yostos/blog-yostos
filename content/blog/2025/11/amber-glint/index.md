A fleeting amber glint catches the edge of autumn leaves, as the late-afternoon sun slips through the quiet street. Each leaf becomes a small lantern, glowing with warmth where light meets color. The canopy above filters the golden hour into fragments of brilliance, revealing the gentle transition from green to gold, a moment suspended between seasons.
