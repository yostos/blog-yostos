I played 'STRAIGHT FROM YOUR HEART' from Masayoshi Takanaka's 1983 album
'CAN I SING?

In the previous year's album 'SAUDADE,' he was using sequencers a bit, but
in this album, he extensively utilized programmed sequences throughout.
After 40 years, it's amazing that these programmed sequences can now be
replicated just using a Mac.

For guitar, I'm using an Aria Pro II PE-1500RI, with PPSE Classic and El
Capistan V2 effects, and a Simplifier MK-II amplifier.
