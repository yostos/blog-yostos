I was intrigued by Minister of Internal Affairs Seiichiro Murakami's remarks at the House of Representatives Committee on Internal Affairs and Communications.

  村上誠一郎総務相は13日の衆院総務委員会で、個人的見解と断った上で、今世紀末に人口が半減するとの推計を踏まえ、現在1700以上ある自治体は「300～400の市で済む」との考えを示した。「極端なことを言うと、県庁はいらないし、道州制も意味がない」との持論も展開した。

While I'm appalled by the Minister's incompetence in accepting population decline as a given rather than addressing it, having worked at a local government affiliated organization, I agree with the notion that municipalities are unnecessary.

These local governments and their affiliated organizations create work by piling up internal administrative operations without being held accountable for results, failing to do what truly needs to be done. Witnessing this firsthand makes me want to agree with his position.
