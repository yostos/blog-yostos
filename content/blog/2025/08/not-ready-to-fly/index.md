Currently copying Masayoshi Takanaka's 'Ready To Fly'. First, I tried to
recreate the guitar ensemble part from the intro section.

I'm overdubbing
with 6 guitars, but I feel like the original track has even more guitars
layered in.
When I think about how they achieved this overdubbing on tape back in the
'70s, I'm truly amazed. The precision and skill required is just incredible.
