A few months ago, I [attended a Takanaka Masayoshi concert](/articles/2025/09/21/takanaka). The encore finale was "You Can Never Come To This Place" - I never imagined I'd get to hear this beloved track from the legendary album "Rainbow Grapefruit" performed live, and I was truly moved.

While the emotion was still fresh, I decided to challenge myself to master this piece before the year ended. With its rapid-fire phrases, I honestly felt like giving up many times, but I kept practicing, remembering the excitement of that concert.
It's far from perfect, but I played it with all my love for this song and the emotion I felt at that concert.
