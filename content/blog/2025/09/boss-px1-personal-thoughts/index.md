A dream-like compact effect pedal that can recreate BOSS's legendary effects in a single unit has been announced. While it's been received relatively positively in Japan, overseas reactions have been quite harsh and critical.

I haven't purchased it myself, but I'd like to share my personal thoughts based on the product information.

## Concerns About the Shift to Subscription Models

The PX-1 comes with 16 built-in effects that can be switched between, with the ability to expand effects by purchasing paid "Model Passes."

To add effects to this model, licenses must be loaded into the pedal through a dedicated app called BOSS Effect Loader. In other words, it's **software**. This additional software is managed not through hardware but through a free Roland account that you create, with licenses tied to your account.

While Roland hasn't made any official announcements, generally speaking, such licenses are often non-transferable. This means the common practice of "selling unwanted effects pedals used" may no longer be possible.

In the US, business models requiring small but recurring additional fees are called "Microtransactions," and there's a significant user base that despises them. More than actual cost-performance considerations, the psychological feeling of being "deceived" when additional costs arise after purchase seems to be the issue.

Additionally, Roland operates Roland Cloud, which can't be considered particularly successful. This has led to user suspicions about a potential future shift to subscription models.

## Can Do Everything, But Only One Thing at a Time

When I first saw this effect pedal announced, my biggest question was "What would you use this for?"

The 16 initial built-in effects span drive, modulation, and spatial categories - a comprehensive selection where "this alone could complete your sound design."

However, as advertised, the PX-1 "dedicates all DSP resources to a single effect for faithful recreation of original tone and response," meaning only one effect can be active at any given time. In other words, while the PX-1 can do everything, it can't complete anything on its own. Depending on which PX-1 effect you activate, the pedal's position and role within your effect board changes entirely.

How would you use such a thing? The moment I saw this, I thought "technically interesting, but I don't need this."

## What Should They Have Done Instead?

Personally, I think they should have grouped effects and created a lineup. PX-1 could handle drive effects, PX-2 could handle modulation, and PX-3 could handle spatial effects. Each could have sold well at the same ~$250 price point as the current PX-1.

For example, if they had limited it to just four drive effects at the current price, I would have purchased it:

- OD-1
- SD-1
- DS-1
- DF-2

Here's why this would have been better:

- It would be cheaper than buying these four effects individually
- For drive effects, ~$250 isn't particularly expensive compared to boutique pedals
- It includes models like OD-1 and DF-2 that are now only available used and have become quite expensive

Ideally, if they had included something like a BD-2, it would have been perfect.

## Conclusion

The BOSS PX-1 is technically excellent and deserves praise for faithfully recreating classic effects. However, for the following reasons, I personally cannot actively recommend this product:

- There's a fundamental contradiction in the product concept of "can do everything but only one thing at a time," resulting in user confusion about how to actually use it.
- By suddenly introducing software into BOSS's traditionally hardware-centric business model, they're creating user anxiety and ignoring the "used market" that their traditional users have supported.

The product has become more of a technical demonstration than a practical tool, earning it the position of an "interesting but unnecessary" product. While I acknowledge BOSS's technical capabilities, this represents a typical example of marketing-driven product development that disregards user practicality.
