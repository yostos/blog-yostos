I tried playing Stevie Nicks' famous song from Fleetwood Mac that I used to
listen to often on the radio when I was a student. I was reminded of this
song after hearing about my family's hardships over the weekend, which
shocked me. Though I don't fully understand the true meaning of this song,
to me it seems to express determination in the face of fear of collapse and
anxiety about the future.
