Years ago, I used to enjoy making woodblock prints and illustrations for
these cards. But the whole process - printing them and writing addresses -
became incredibly tedious, and I&apos;ve grown to despise this custom over the
past few years. What&apos;s worse, most of these cards go to distant relatives
whose faces I can barely remember, or work contacts I haven&apos;t seen in years.

Unable to make a clean break from the tradition, I&apos;ve been lazily
outsourcing everything to a printing service these past few years - from
printing to mailing. It&apos;s simple enough: pick a stock illustration and
message, check off names from my saved address book, and I&apos;m done.

But what&apos;s the point of all this?

And in this digital age, why are we still relying on physical mail?

I ordered my New Year&apos;s cards from the printing service again this year.
However, this time I added one crucial line: "As I reach a turning point in
my life, I&apos;ll be switching to email for New Year&apos;s greetings from next year
onward."
