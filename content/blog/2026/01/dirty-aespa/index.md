## The Ratings Drop Mystery

Online rumors have been circulating that the approximately 4% viewership drop around 8 PM during NHK's New Year's Eve Kohaku music show corresponds to **aespa's** performance time. The group has been embroiled in controversy after posting images of atomic bomb mushroom cloud figures on X (formerly Twitter).

However, the reality is quite different and somewhat ironic. aespa's actual performance time was later in the evening. The time slot during this ratings dip was actually occupied by Time Machine 3's live broadcast from Kusatsu Onsen hot springs.

## The Broader Issue

Regardless of the timing discrepancy, I cannot forgive NHK's decision to feature this controversial group while ignoring the voices of many viewers. This is particularly insensitive given that the show's hosts, Hiroyuki Ariyoshi and Haruka Ayase, are both from Hiroshima.


The group's insensitive actions and NHK's controversial decision to feature them remain deeply problematic. This is true even if one considers that their behavior may stem from anti-Japanese education.

まぁ、実際には出演時間帯はもう少し遅く、この落ち込んでいる時間帯は

しかし、反日教育されているとはいえ、あの非常識なグループと多くの視聴者の声を無視したNHKのことは、絶対に許しません。

だって、司会をやっていた有吉弘行と綾瀬はるかは広島出身だからな。
