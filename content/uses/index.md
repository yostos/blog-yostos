## Workstation

14-inch MacBook Pro, M3 Max, 36GB RAM (2023)
: I have been using a Mac since the 2000s.
From the 2010s, I was able to use a Mac for work as well.
Now I rely on it in almost every scenario.

Dell 34 Curved Gaming Monitor (S3422DWG)
: The Dell 34 Curved Gaming Monitor offers an immersive 3440x1440
ultra-wide resolution and a 165Hz refresh rate.
This makes it perfect for both work and gaming.
The VA panel delivers deep blacks and vibrant colors.
AMD FreeSync Premium Pro ensures a smooth experience without screen tearing.

Keychron Q60 QMK Custom Mechanical Keyboard
: The Keychron Q60 is a high-quality 60% mechanical keyboard.
I have customized mine with Gateron Jupiter Banana switches.
The hot-swappable PCB makes it highly customizable.

PFU HHKB PROFESSIONAL HYBRID TYPE-S (SNOW)
: It is the well-known Happy Hacking Keyboard.
I have been using it since the first generation released in 1997.
I am so used to it that I cannot work without it.
The typing experience is great and lightweight to carry around.
It is durable and the best keyboard out there.

## Development tools

NeoVim powered by LazyVim
: The fancy IDE features that everyone relies on just get in the way for me. I used to be an Emacs devotee, but now the venerable but new NeoVim is the best text editor out there.

WezTerm
: I'm honestly not even sure what features I get with this that aren't just part of the macOS Terminal but it's what I use.

## Design

Pixelmator Pro
: I use this software for image processing, which is Mac-specific and fast, reasonably priced compared to Photoshop, and it works well for me.

## Productivity

LaunchBar
: Not the newest, but the fastest, Alfred seems to be the favorite, but I've been using this launcher for a long time.

## Guitars

YAMAHA REVSTAR RSP20
: A high-quality YAMAHA guitar made in Japan.
While it is sometimes perceived as a budget version of the YAMAHA SG,
it features practical specifications like contour body shaping and
chamber construction.
The 5-way pickup selector makes it a straightforward and highly playable instrument.

Fender 70th Anniversary American Vintage II 1954 Stratocaster
: The 70th anniversary Stratocaster model released in 2024.
It is a faithful recreation of the 1954 original.
This particular one weighs under 3.5kg with a dry pristine tone.

AriaPro II PE-1500RI
: A reissue of AriaPro's flagship PE-1500, designed with their own interpretation in 1970s Japan when Les Paul replicas were popular. With an all-maple body and a 648mm scale—the same as a Stratocaster—it delivers a brighter tone than a typical Les Paul while maintaining its own character.

Epiphone CASINO
: A 1983 Epiphone CASINO. Built by Matsumoku Industries in Japan during this period, it's often referred to as "Japan Vintage" and has exceptional build quality that rivals many American-made examples from the same era.

Epiphone USA Texan (FT-79)
: Handcrafted by Gibson luthiers at the Bozeman Montana factory.
While it shares the body design with the Gibson J-45,
the Texan uses a regular 25.5-inch scale.
This gives it higher string tension and a brighter tone than the J-45.
